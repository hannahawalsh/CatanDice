# CatanDice [![Open in Streamlit](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://share.streamlit.io/hannahawalsh/catandice/Game_Setup.py)
Catan is such a game of strategy that it's annoying when you're hit with bad luck. Thus, this Gambler's Fallacy dice app makes Catan an even more strategic game.  

This app uses a script that updates the probability to be not that of two fair dice, but to be weighted more toward numbers that are "due."

This app uses [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/), which is an awesome Python package for creating dashboards and small applications.

If you are having trouble installing streamlit, run  
```
conda install -c conda-forge watchdog
conda install protobuf
pip install streamlit
```
